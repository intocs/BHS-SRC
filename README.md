How to Start Developing
-----------------------

1. Read up on the Git versioning system (at least a little)
2. Get some sort of software to help you with Git ( either Atlassian SourceTree or the GitHub Client are recommended).

   Or, if you're feeling particularly masochistic, you can always use the command line. Your call.
3. Clone this repository, and navigate to it's location in Terminal.
4. Checkout the "Develop" branch (you can do this within the terminal by typing ``` git checkout develop ```)
5. Type ``` scripts/init.sh ``` to load all the things
     - If this doesn't work at first, first type ``` chmod +x scripts/init.sh ```, and then try again. This should make ``` init.sh ``` executable
6. browse dank memes

You should now have a fully functioning working copy of the code. Comments should be in each major file detailing how they work and their purpose. If you have any questions, Slack is your friend. (OR SO THEY SAY. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH)
